## Creating Applications

To create a new Oak application:
- import `Application` from `oak`
- Create an instance of `Application`
- Pass a dictionary with any [config](https://github.com/wyattcast44/oak) values to the constructor
- Call the `run` method on the `Application`

```python
from oak import Application

a = Application({
    'name': 'Oak CLI App',
    'env': 'dev',
    'version': '0.1.0',
}).run()
```

That's it! You've created your first `Oak` application ðŸŽ‰! It doesn't do anything yet because we haven't added any commands or options, keep reading to start adding functionality to your app.
